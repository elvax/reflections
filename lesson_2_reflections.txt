What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git is created to store data changes 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

git branch - pokazuje gałęzie projekty
git branch "nazwa" - tworzy nową gałąź
git checkout "branch name" - ustawia gałąź

git -b new_brach_name == git branch new_brach_name
						 git checkout new_brach_name
